## üìù Writing Philosophy

These guides are written in the trenches, by developers who've shipped real products using these tools. No marketing fluff. No theoretical BS. Just what works, what doesn't, and the ugly truth about building with AI tools in production.

Each guide includes:
- ‚úÖ **Real-world usage examples** with actual code
- ‚úÖ **Open source alternatives** with GitHub links
- ‚úÖ **Pricing breakdowns** and cost optimization tips
- ‚úÖ **Production gotchas** you won't find in the docs
- ‚úÖ **Integration patterns** that actually scale

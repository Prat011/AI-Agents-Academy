# What are AI Agents?

## Introduction

AI agents are autonomous software programs that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined scripts, AI agents can adapt, learn, and respond to changing conditions in real-time.

## Core Characteristics

### 1. **Autonomy**
- Operate independently without constant human intervention
- Make decisions based on their programming and learned experiences
- Can initiate actions proactively to achieve their objectives

### 2. **Reactivity** 
- Respond to changes in their environment
- Process incoming information and adjust behavior accordingly
- Handle unexpected situations gracefully

### 3. **Proactivity**
- Take initiative to achieve goals
- Plan and execute multi-step strategies
- Anticipate future needs and prepare accordingly

### 4. **Social Ability**
- Communicate with other agents, systems, and humans
- Collaborate and coordinate with multiple entities
- Share information and negotiate when needed

## Types of AI Agents

### Simple Reflex Agents
- React to current perceptions only
- Follow condition-action rules
- No memory of past events
- **Example**: Thermostat, basic chatbots

### Model-Based Reflex Agents
- Maintain internal state/model of the world
- Use memory to handle partially observable environments
- **Example**: Autonomous vehicles, smart home systems

### Goal-Based Agents
- Have explicit goals and objectives
- Plan sequences of actions to achieve goals
- Evaluate different possible futures
- **Example**: Navigation systems, game-playing AI

### Utility-Based Agents
- Optimize for utility/performance measures
- Make trade-offs between competing objectives
- Handle uncertainty and conflicting goals
- **Example**: Trading algorithms, resource allocation systems

### Learning Agents
- Improve performance over time
- Adapt to new environments and situations
- Learn from experience and feedback
- **Example**: Recommendation systems, personal assistants
